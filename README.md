## Overview

This app scores data from multiple Implicit Association Tests (IATs) using a latent variable modeling approach, as described in Carpenter et al. (2023). It was used to support analyses for the published study.

---

## Features

- Interactive Shiny interface for scoring multiple IATs
- Implements model-based scoring approach from Carpenter et al. (2023)
- Useful for researchers studying individual differences in implicit bias
